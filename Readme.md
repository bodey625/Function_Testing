## Function Testing:

This is a folder to keep track of VERY simple things as i prototype the concepts i may need in more advanced programs. 

if nothing else, this repo will demonstrate my ability to learn the functions of different modules, languages, or frameworks. 

im also hoping this repo will be a convenient tool if i ever need to reuse one of the projects concepts within.
